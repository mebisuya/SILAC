All of the code and data needed to reproduce the figures is included in this folder.

The main script "Turnover_analysis_mouse_v_human_v06.Rmd" refers to the files in this folder by name.

All libraries used are referred to in the initial setup chunks of the script. Any non-CRAN packages are labelled as such with additional functions to download from Bioconductor.

R version 3.4 or later is recommended. No additional software is required.

Instructions on installing R and R studio can be found online, e.g., under
https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html

No separate Demo files are included, as the data files themselves are small enough that a regular laptop is expected to run the entire script in less than 60 minutes. Expected outputs of the script are included as underlying data tables for each of the reproduced figures. Running the entire Rmarkdown (.Rmd) file will reproduce all of the figures and underlying tables covering the proteomics data analysis.
